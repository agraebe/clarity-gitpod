# Clarity Gitpod Starter

This repository is a base for writing Clarity smart contracts with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io).

To try it out, just click on this button:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/hstove/clarity-gitpod)

When you click that button, Gitpod will start a new workspace for you. It'll have all dependencies pre-installed, and it even has support for syntax highlighting and the Clarity Language Server.

The workspace will start a new task, running `yarn test:watch`. Whenever you save a `.clar` or `.ts` file, your tests will be re-ran.
