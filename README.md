# Getting Started with smart contracts

Blockstack's smart contracting language, Clarity, is designed for writing smart contracts on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. It supports programmatic control over digital assets.

## Learn more about Clarity

To learn more about smart contracts, use cases, and design basics, visit https://docs.blockstack.org/core/smart/overview.html.

## Tinker around

To play around with a sample contract, open up the [contracts/hello-world.clar](Hello World) file.

If you want to explore the language features, open up the [Clarity REPL](https://lgalabru.github.io/clarity-repl/).

## Start a tutorial

Start with the [Hello World tutorial](tutorial.html), then learn how to construct [a counter](tutorial-counter.html), and finally, learn how to [test your smart contracts](tutorial-test.html) using Mocha.

## Review the language references

Once you've got the hang of the general workflow, environment, and language syntax, you should be ready to start writing contracts, referring to the [Clarity language reference](clarityRef.html) as you go.
